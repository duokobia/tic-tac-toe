# tic-tac-toe
This is a tic-tac-toe game created in vanilla JS.



WHAT IT DOES

This is a game that is played on a grid and assigns the winner to the first player to achieve 3 consecutive marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie

THINGS I LEARNED
Starting to create web apps with libraries like ReactJS made me overlook the basis of vanilla JS. Down the line, I kept wondering what added value these libraries and frameworks brings to development and I decided to revisit the basis. This is the first step of creating the tic-tac-toe game. My objective is to see the similarities and differences in implementation using vanillaJS and other frameworks and libraries.

Learning how to create components without the use of frameworks and libraries



HOW TO RUN THE APP

On your terminal,

cd Tic-tac-toe
right click on your index.html file and click open with live server
